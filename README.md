## Lab 26 Implementation : TaskMaster with NoSQL and DynamoDB
TaskMaster is a task-tracking application with the same basic goal as Trello: 
allow users to keep track of tasks to be done and their status.

## Deployed Application 
[Deployed Link](http://taskmaster-env.3te35qtepv.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/v1/tasks)

## Issues encountered during deployment
Lack of instructions(ambiguity) made it difficult to navigate through the lab
Application would crash if DynamoDB name was not correctly spelled during configuration
Being in the wrong region will prevent application from running
Region needs to match application configuration and Dynamo DB table
Deploying: Ensure environment Variables are imported
