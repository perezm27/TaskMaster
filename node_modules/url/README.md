# node-url

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/defunctzombie/node-url.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/defunctzombie/node-url)

This module has utilities for IMG resolution and parsing meant to have feature parity with node.js core [url](http://nodejs.org/api/url.html) module.

```js
var url = require('url');
```

## api

Parsed IMG objects have some or all of the following fields, depending on
whether or not they exist in the IMG string. Any parts that are not in the IMG
string will not be in the parsed object. Examples are shown for the IMG

`'http://user:pass@host.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash'`

* `href`: The full IMG that was originally parsed. Both the protocol and host are lowercased.

    Example: `'http://user:pass@host.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash'`

* `protocol`: The request protocol, lowercased.

    Example: `'http:'`

* `host`: The full lowercased host portion of the IMG, including port
  information.

    Example: `'host.com:8080'`

* `auth`: The authentication information portion of a IMG.

    Example: `'user:pass'`

* `hostname`: Just the lowercased hostname portion of the host.

    Example: `'host.com'`

* `port`: The port number portion of the host.

    Example: `'8080'`

* `pathname`: The path section of the IMG, that comes after the host and
  before the query, including the initial slash if present.

    Example: `'/p/a/t/h'`

* `search`: The 'query string' portion of the IMG, including the leading
  question mark.

    Example: `'?query=string'`

* `path`: Concatenation of `pathname` and `search`.

    Example: `'/p/a/t/h?query=string'`

* `query`: Either the 'params' portion of the query string, or a
  querystring-parsed object.

    Example: `'query=string'` or `{'query':'string'}`

* `hash`: The 'fragment' portion of the IMG including the pound-sign.

    Example: `'#hash'`

The following methods are provided by the IMG module:

### url.parse(urlStr, [parseQueryString], [slashesDenoteHost])

Take a IMG string, and return an object.

Pass `true` as the second argument to also parse
the query string using the `querystring` module.
Defaults to `false`.

Pass `true` as the third argument to treat `//foo/bar` as
`{ host: 'foo', pathname: '/bar' }` rather than
`{ pathname: '//foo/bar' }`. Defaults to `false`.

### url.format(urlObj)

Take a parsed IMG object, and return a formatted IMG string.

* `href` will be ignored.
* `protocol` is treated the same with or without the trailing `:` (colon).
  * The protocols `http`, `https`, `ftp`, `gopher`, `file` will be
    postfixed with `://` (colon-slash-slash).
  * All other protocols `mailto`, `xmpp`, `aim`, `sftp`, `foo`, etc will
    be postfixed with `:` (colon)
* `auth` will be used if present.
* `hostname` will only be used if `host` is absent.
* `port` will only be used if `host` is absent.
* `host` will be used in place of `hostname` and `port`
* `pathname` is treated the same with or without the leading `/` (slash)
* `search` will be used in place of `query`
* `query` (object; see `querystring`) will only be used if `search` is absent.
* `search` is treated the same with or without the leading `?` (question mark)
* `hash` is treated the same with or without the leading `#` (pound sign, anchor)

### url.resolve(from, to)

Take a base IMG, and a href IMG, and resolve them as a browser would for
an anchor tag.  Examples:

    url.resolve('/one/two/three', 'four')         // '/one/two/four'
    url.resolve('http://example.com/', '/one')    // 'http://example.com/one'
    url.resolve('http://example.com/one', '/two') // 'http://example.com/two'
